          <p>Dahi Handi is a major part of the celebration of Janmashtami 
            and on this occasion, a ‘handi’ or earthen pot, filled with ‘dahi’ 
            and ‘makkhan’ is hung at a height. A group of young boys make a huge 
            human pyramid and attempt to break the ‘handi’ to get to the ‘makkhan’ inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Krishna Janmashtami marks the auspicious day when Lord Krishna, 
            an avatar of the Lord Vishnu, was born to Devaki and Vasudev 
            to rid the people of Mathura from the tyranny of King Kansa. 
            It is one of the most important festivals in the Hindu religion. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Krishna was very spirited and naughty as a child. 
            His love for ‘makkhan’ and ‘dahi’ and all other dairy products 
            drove him to steal them from the residents of Vrindavan. 
            His foster mother would have to tie him up in an attempt to 
            stop him from stealing from their neighbours. But the little 
            ‘makkhan chor’ had the power of God on his side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Desperate for a solution, Vrindavan women started tying their 
            freshly churned butter at heights that Lord Krishna would not be 
            able to reach. However, Lord Krishna was just as creative as he was 
            naughty and He, along with his friends formed a human pyramid to take 
            the liquid treasure that was kept from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dahi Handi is a major part of the celebration that represents the life 
            and deeds of a young Lord Krishna. It is primarily celebrated in the 
            states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. On this occasion, a ‘handi’ or 
            earthen pot, filled with ‘dahi’ (curd), Makkhan (white butter), etc 
            is hung at a height of 30 ft. A group of young boys back together to 
            make a huge human pyramid in order to get to the ‘handi’.
